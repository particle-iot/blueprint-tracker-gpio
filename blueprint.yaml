introduction: |
  This application note illustrates several hardware and software techniques:
  - Expanding the Tracker One using the M8 connector.
  - Interfacing with 5V I2C devices (optional).
  - Adding a MCP23008 to add 8 GPIO. Can be configured as 3.3V or 5V GPIO at board assembly time.

description: |
  This project demonstrates how to expand the Tracker One’s GPIO capabilities using the M8 connector and an MCP23008 I2C GPIO expander. By incorporating the MCP23008, users can gain eight additional GPIO pins, each configurable as input, input pull-up, or output. This setup also provides flexibility for operating at either 3.3V or 5V, depending on assembly configuration.

  Using this GPIO expander allows for numerous application possibilities, from monitoring multiple input sources to controlling external components. Optional level-shifting techniques are detailed to enable safe interfacing with 5V logic devices, as the Tracker One’s MCU supports only 3.3V.
